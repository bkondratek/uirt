{pmore}
{it:varlist} must include only variables that were declared in the main list
of items of the current {cmd:uirt} run.  If {it:varlist} is skipped or an
asterisk ({cmd:*}) is used, {cmd:uirt_sx2} will either display the results
that are currently stored in the {cmd:e(item_fit_SX2)} matrix or compute the
S-X2 item-fit statistic for all items declared in the main list of items of
the current {cmd:uirt} run.  This behavior depends on whether S-X2 item-fit
statistics were produced by the current {cmd:uirt} run.

{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:uirt_sx2} is a postestimation command of {helpb uirt} that computes the
classical S-X2 statistic proposed by Orlando and Thissen (2000).  It is
available only for dichotomous items, and it cannot be used in a multigroup
setting.  The number-correct score used for grouping is obtained from
dichotomous items -- if polytomous items are present in data, they are ignored
in the computation of S-X2.  If a dichotomous item has missing responses, it
is also ignored in the computation of S-X2.  The results are stored in
{cmd:r(item_fit_SX2)}.


{marker option}{...}
{title:Option}

{phang}
{opt minfreq(#)} sets a minimum for both NP and NQ integrated over any ability
interval, where N is the number of observations, P is the expected item mean,
and Q=(1-P).  The default is {cmd:minfreq(1)}.
